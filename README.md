# Game of Life

This project uses Gradle and JavaFX 21. You need JDK 21 or later.

## Building

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Running

```bash
./gradlew run
```

The runnable JAR is created in `build/libs/game-of-life.jar`.

## Testing

```
./gradlew test

## Archive

The old `BCR_report_builder` project was moved to its own repository and
removed from this build. The `archive/` directory is ignored so it no longer
appears in builds or source packages.
